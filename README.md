# Guestbook.ing

A simple SaaS guestbook for event participants.

**Visit the live application:** [www.guestbook.ing](www.guestbook.ing)

## Overview

Guestbook.ing provides event holders with a straightforward way to collect details from their attendees. Participants can easily leave their names and email in a digital guestbook that the event organizer can then view.

## Built With Spaceport

This project was created as an example application to showcase the capabilities of **Spaceport**, a full-stack web framework. It demonstrates how quickly and efficiently a functional web application can be built using Spaceport's features.

## Live-Coded at Toledo.codes

The majority of this project was live-coded during a Toledo.codes event held at the Toledo Tech Loft. This hands-on session provided a real-time demonstration of the development process using Spaceport.
